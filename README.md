# Credit Card Default Analysis: Clustering & Dimensionality Reduction

This project applies **unsupervised machine learning techniques** to a **credit card customer dataset** to identify hidden customer segments and reduce data dimensionality.  
The analysis focuses on **clustering**, **feature scaling**, and **dimensionality reduction** to better understand customer behavior related to credit usage and default risk.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains **credit card customer information**, including:

- Credit limit
- Balance
- Purchase behavior
- Cash advance activity
- Payment history
- Credit utilization metrics

The dataset is high-dimensional, making it suitable for **dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis**.
